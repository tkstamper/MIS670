"0:27 | Max parachute depth - Hold “S” at any speed for ~2 seconds, then look down and hold “W”, this will make you reach the maximum depth regardless of speed.
00:40 | Bridge camp spot - Video shows the spot. (Miirex)
1:03 | Roof spot - Video shows the spot.
1:22 | Sit in the same side - If you’re two players in a vehicle, sit in the same side. The driver will most likely prioritize himself and stop to have the car covering him.
1:28 | Switch gun while driving/swimming - Dragging your weapon slots across each other, will determine which gun you hold when you leave a car / getting up from a swim.
1:37 | Jump diving - You do not take fall damage by jumping from high altitude into water. Unless the server is under heavy load and causes a lot of desync.
1:46 | Don’t get knocked in water - You’ll drown while being knocked, crawl out the water if possible before getting helped up.
2:08 | Shoot tires for cover - If you’re in a bad situation, you can take out the tires of your vehicle to get more cover - and less of a chance of being hit while prone.
2:19 | Disable character render - Increases FPS for most players.
2:31 | Do not trust any vehicles - They will betray you.
2:43 | Airdrop drop time - Flat ground lands slower than on a mountain, as the plane has the exact same height every time.
2:59 | Crouch in shallow water - Crouch running while being in shallow water will make you move faster.
3:14 | Small weapon top slot - Pulling a weapon out from your first weapon slot, drags it over the shoulder, secondary slot drags it by the waist. (Easier to spot if you're hiding in a bush.) Keep the smallest weapon in the top slot.
3:22 | BHOP backwards - Bunny hopping allows you to move faster backwards, while still spotting for potential enemies. Simply spam jump while moving backwards.
3:29 | Unflip car with nade - Sometimes it works, sometimes it blows. Proceed with caution.
3:39 | Zeroing on thumb buttons - If you want to get good with zeroing, this is a very easy way to learn how to do it and get comfortable doing it.
3:46 | Avoid flashbangs - If a flash is thrown at you, look away and you will only have to deal with the loud noise.
3:55 | View distance - Does not affect player models, only environment like grass. Use very low. (Scrollax)
4:07 | Drop backpack late game - Late game you won’t have any use for your backpack, get rid of it and become a stealthy ninja, you won’t need 200 beans and 27 first aid kits.
4:22 | Bait with goodies - Placing bait/traps is a good way to throw an enemy player off of his/hers game, thinking the area has yet to be looted.
4:33 | 3rd person camera - Breaking windows will allow you to third person with the camera and see more outside.
4:45 | Mark before jump - Sometimes you get thrown out facing a wierd angle, set a mark to help you locate your landing zone.
4:57 | Max parachute speed - 234 km/h is the max parachute speed
5:04 | Tour de Bunkers - Take your vehicle through the bunkers, and loot with on the go.
5:25 | Swim faster - It’s faster to swim below the water than above. (apopk4)
5:32 | Jump on hills - It’s a little faster on steep hills, and more silent. Simply spam jump, will be fixed in 1.0.
5:40 | Up and down in water - Pressing C while swimming will make your character dive instantly, pressing spacebar will spit you back up.
5:49 | Map details - The Yellow squares indicates 1000 M. (1 KM) while the white squares indicates 100 M.
5:59 | Leave game without penalty - Before you get in the plane you’re safe to leave the game, without any impact on your rating.
6:03 | 2 ways 2 nade - Clicking right click will toggle which of the two ways you'll be throwing your grenade.
6:09 | Loot on the go - Drag or press “F” on items while running over them
6:15 | Use alt key in bushes - Holding ALT will only move your head when you sit in a bush, and not your entire body. This makes you harder to spot.
6:26 | Roof jump - Video shows the spot.
6:43 | Cook grenades - Grenades have a 5 second timer, count in your head to make the best timed throw. Flashbangs are quicker.
6:53 | Jump out of boats  - You can exit boats at full speed going in a straight line, doing it while turned will most likely get you killed.
7:02 | Split loot stacks - There's two ways to do this: CTRL + Drag it out and CTRL + Right Click. You can mark the amount with your mouse or CTRL+A.
7:18 | Full boost meter - The almost perfect amount for the heal/sprint meter is 1 Painkillers and 1 Energy drink. Starting with the Painkillers.
7:34 | Peak left and right - 3PP - To change which shoulder you're peeking with, simply press Q or E while holding down Right Mouse Button.
7:42 | Turn brake lights off - Jump out at very low speed to get the brake lights turned off.
7:54 | Run while boosting - You can run before your healing is done, at 0.5 without cancelling the effect.
8:00 | Heal and move - If you’re exposed while healing, move a little bit to reduce the odds of being hit. You can also spam crouch.
8:06 | Control the bikes - With CTRL, SPACE, Q and E in the air.
8:14 | Tour de apartments - Use your bike to travel to new luxurious locations. See video for example.
8:27 | Buggy boost - You can reach top speed with the buggy without using boost.
8:34 | Can’t shoot through water - But you can kill them with a grenade. (tombull89)
8:41 | Punch tires - A tire can be punched out.
8:50 | Buggy brake light spawns on
8:55 | Mute game - If you don’t want to go deaf at the age of 5, use CTRL + M to mute the game while in the lobby and plane. This will be fixed in patch 1.0.
9:04 | Smokes are client side - Meaning, the opponent will have a different smoke than the one you see, so one of you might have an advantage. This will be fixed in patch 1.0.
9.16 | Click attachments - Right clicking your attachments will make it faster to equip/unequip them.
9:28 | Queue the bandages - Using your bandages in a chain is a waste, pop the next after the 2nd tick of the previous.
9:51 | Suppressor does not give compensation - See video for proof.
10:02 | Jumping out of moving vehicles - Does no longer work, save the pain, don’t be like me.
10:18 | Spawn island loot disappears -  When the game begins, and regular loot is placed on the island.
10:23 | 10 second revive - It takes 10 seconds to get a team member up and going again.
10:37 | Footsteps ground floor versus upstairs - Different sounds, see video for example.
10:50 | Shoes and barefeet - Different sounds, see video for example.
11:02 | Crossbow scope - Indicators are 50, 100 and 200 meters.
11:16 | Don’t run/drive in a straight line - If you’re in a open field, change your running path so snipers hopefully miss their shot on you. (Sasha)
11:24 | Don’t shoot right away - Take your time, get the perfect shot. Try to predict what they might be doing next - what would you do?
11:34 | Crouch jump - Easiest way to do it, is placing your finger in between spacebar + c, and click at the same time with 1 finger. Will be gone in patch 1.0.
11:53 | AKM spray is garbage - Can we all just agree on this.
12:02 | Red dot vs holo - In patch 1.0 you can turn up the brightness, but right now the red dot is hard to see against light backgrounds compared to the holographic sight.
12:16 | Drunk bridge architect - Not a tip, scammed.
12:20 | Jump on rooftops in Pochinki - Use it to jump around and keep Gotham safe.
12:55 | Keep compensator - A compensator will almost always be better in the end in a 1v1. And will also be better to have on if you’re driving or running in an open area where another player is more likely to shoot first.
13:11 | S12K Attachments - Can attach 8x, 15x and suppressor to this bad boy.
13:18 | Dropping guns with no room - Will drop all the ammo on the ground too, if you have room, the ammo will go in your inventory.
13:27 | See your snips - Holding left click after taking a sniper shot, will keep you scoped and able to see a far shot and adjust accordingly.
13:43 | Level 3 helmet - Helmets are important late game, a low health level 3 helmet is still better than a full health level 2, as it can save you from a kar98 headshot late game.
13:55 | Level 3 backpack - You will never have the use for the entire room of a level 3 backpack in Solo Queue, stick to a level 2, it makes it easier to hide in the terrain.
14:16 | Tough fence - Drive faster than 60 km/h to take these bad boys down.
14:35 | Punch out tires - I accidently put this twice, lul nub. Bonus tip at the bottom.
14:40 | 1 Tire is not enough - Vehicles can still be driven with 1 tire shot, it’s a bit drifty - but it’s doable.
14:51 | First person - 3PP - Use 1st person view in 3rd person, can help you spot those darn airdrops easier from bushes.
14:59 | 3-Seater bike is a death trap - Statement.
15:09 | Get on the outer wall - By jumping out the plane and parachuting right away, you can get on the wall surrounding the island - this is completely useless and the circle will kill you.
15:22 | Bind auto run - Works while swimming too, but not driving.
15:31 | Boat to spawn island - You can still go there by boat after the game begins.
15:42 | Spawn island loot nerfed - They did this to bring more loot to Khameski.
15:52 | Unreachable airdrops - If the circle reaches beyond the map, the airdrop can land on a big invisible wall and will be unobtainable.
16:05 | Call your color - In squads, call your color instead of your name. It makes it a lot easier to coordinate with your team. (EXPAttack)
16:19 | Voice chats - CTRL + T to mute, CTRL + Y to change channels. Saves you the time of going to the menu every time.
16:26 | Bring loot for team - Early game, loot all attachments and hook your team members up in the end of your looting spree.
16:43 | Unflip car with a car - Simply ram that sucker.
16:55 | Catch the first drop - Drive to the center of the first circle ASAP, wait for the drop - go get it.
17:22 | Players are greedy - Example in video.

So nice ty. I'm having a blast.
Excellent vid man

I got a fortnite ad on this....
"It is not ""watertown"" dude, it`s ""sunken"" hehe ;) Any other?"
"he did show the punching tires twice but some people had there audio off cause they did not listen to what he said.Here's what he said 
1st time:
if u are in a situation where u are using vehicle as a cover and u do not have gun then break the tires as this will lower the vehicle and u will not be able to get shot below the vehicle
2nd time:
if u wanna make it difficult for your enemy to escape then break all the tires as breaking only one or two still allows your enemy to escape with vehicle.

the guy did a fantastic job making this video."
New players should not watch this. So much of this is no longer valid or correct.
thank u man!! <3
11:12 what ???
@5:04 lol stupidest crap i ever saw lol funnyy
Could you please update this movie for latest version of pubg?
"I feel for new players coming into this game. The game has matured and levelled out to a point where what you now have is mainly experienced players who have been playing since beta or close to it. Most players you'll come up against know the game like the back of their hand. They know all the loot/vehicle spawns, they know the weapons and when to use what weapon, they know the little tricks such as jumping off of the apartments onto the second floor to get a better weapons before you come down the stairs with your pistol lol, they know the map and terrain inside out along with maximum parachuting efficiency meaning they can get anywhere as quickly as is possible, they know the direction that players will most likely be coming from, they know the circle strategies etc etc. 


The SR's are OP in this game and will one shot even a level 2 helmet and this is what you'll be dealing with allot of the time. They know the best loot spots with the highest probability of getting an SR. You won't even see the player who kills you allot of the time. They definitely need to re-balance the SR's in this game. A level two helmet should be able to withstand one head shot although your health should then be depleted to something like 10%/20%. If you get it tot he face then sure, it's a one shot kill.


As a new player, these guides are useful for teaching the basic mechanics but beyond that, the only way to get competent is to play play play and learn by your mistakes. It's a long and often frustrating process because you're having to learn about the majority who already know it. The root problem is that there aren't many new players coming into the game now."

"7:03 there's two ways to do this
yet this isn't defined"
"Thank you Fugglet for all the good advices, even though my memory have hard to keep it all.

One thing that came to my mind regarding as a tip is to NOT stay close to a wall, door or anything that can reveal your present and location. The reason is that parts of you and / or your gun might be shown on the other side of the wall or door do to a ""glitch"" in the game. That is something I come to think of when I started play PC-games online back when Call of Duty & United Offensive expansion pack came out. That ""glitch"" is something I come across in many FPS games during the years, so now I always stay some 1-2 feet out of a wall if needed."
Thanks GG vid

Balconys are better than rooftops at sniping cause rooftops are fully open and you are so visibleand shootble but at balconys its harder for someone to shoot you"
Also if u need loot you can kill your teammates an take theirs
Swimming on the surface and third person is faster than swimming in first person. You kind of tread the water in first person.
Excelente

Everyone is stupid all sniper rifles 2x 4x 8x scope but assault rifles are always red dot.

"0:22 who heard ""Hentai"" ?"
also if you and your teammates are on low hp at the last 4v4 then screw hide somewhere like in those weird sheds that are one room and appear on roads
"04:00 ""set view distance to very low"" I disagree, you can't see vehicles or buildings from far with that setting. Many people have recommended to set everything at low or very low depending on your PC but keep view distance to high or ultra."
"bruh ur voice is calming and i legit watched this whole video because it was so good and not annoying, and I didnt even skip ahead with the arrow keys"

Wait wtf there was royalsky
I can control ak recoil better than m416 :v
music at the beginning?
Excellent Tips
Play aggressive on the smaller side of the circle when it's small
Your player model runs faster if you don't have a weapon equipped
Another tip play very aggressive most players expect you to stay behind cover hide in bushes and generally stay away from them but if your very aggressive and you hunt down everyone you see they'll get scared and there shots won't be as accurate
Congrats dude I be shakey because I was watching a scary video and brrrr
"The thing regarding view distance has changed since recent updates. You will want your view distance on at least medium as the further out trees and buildings will not have the correct models, so anyone hiding at one is going to be harder to see. At least, this was the case for me.

Also, you no longer have to wait for the tick on bandages. It stacks now... Thank god haha. This game seems to change quick"
Bikes are the worst!!
"Awesome ^^
U put punching tires twice btw :)"
"""pwepol might not fwall fow it"""
"As this video helped me a lot with getting better in this game I wish you could make an update of this as some tips and tricks won't work now because they got patched :)

16:40 id bring you the rank 3 helmet fam
Do you plan on doing an updated version of this? or is there one?
Great video thank you subscribed
For some reason in watched to the end
if you catch the airdrop on a car you can drive around and take it with you
You can still crouch jump by using jump only.
Thank you for actually having video examples of what you are talking about.  Other tip videos are just a guy playing through a game and whats on the screen doesn’t relate to the tip at all.  It’s absolutely useless so thank you for putting in the time.
Background music??

Somebody copied you dude coconutbrah 100 tips and tricks

"ctrl+T swaps my mic settings from mute, unmute. ctrl+m is for master volume for me by default. Also 1.0 didn't change the loudness of the plane xD Still can't hear anybody talking besides people on the plane."

"Hey dude, you might have a fix for it, since you use Shadowplay as well. As far as I have tested, I only have stuttering in Overwatch, but not always, it comes from time to time, sometimes full gameplays are not affected. Sometimes, the video is halfway through just broken, not able to be played. Only affects Overwatch. Any idea?"
Watched the whole vid me and squad won 5 games I 4hrs is that pretty good
you said punching tires twice lol
"5:12 - 5:16 , When you remember your parents are home"
He may as well have just said all controls as the 100 tips if he thinks THOSE are tips and tricks
If your teammate doesn’t speak English shoot him and take the loot.  Communication is key but a m4 is more key.
"""that annoying REEE""
Fucking lost it there"
Sweet video dude I was wondering about the spawn island lol
why are your videos so saturated?
"Camp there with a VSS and i'm set for a fun game?

Shame. You and me have a very different idea of what a fun game is.
And I also dislike the VSS because of it's poor damage. Give me an AWM or a M24 and i'll be set though. I'll settle for a Kar98."
It’s technically like 92 tips and punching tires
dont stand in the fogg ona hill
How do I cook grenades on console

You sound like the narrator from interplanetary tv in rick and morty
"Tip 101: Don't queue with someone named ""Bayonex"", I'm hot garbage."
Song/music?
when running near a hill run about 3/4 of the way up if getting to the top isn't your objective at that point. This gives the option of running to the bottom or up to the top if your attacked. Chances are that far up people wont notice you anyway.
No a-fence but your ps looks like a high tech coffee maker that also makes the cup
best tip. in 2s down a player and instantly kill him. run away. this will ruin their day
"Lol, the ad on this vid is of some DIRECT copy of PUBG. What a bullshit."

"VSS Vintorez Tip- The Chevrons indicate 100meters. The little sloped boxes perfectly fit an enemy at 100, 200, 300, and 400 meters going from left to right. To clarify the sloped boxes, I mean from the point where the slope intersects the vertical line to the bottom horizontal line.
TL;DR - The scope is a rangefinder"
best tip i got was the call teammates for color... thanks god... take my like
"9:35 useless in 1.0, they stack as you put them on you"
"How does your game look so vibrant and colorful, is it because of the editing or do you actually play like that?"
Players are greedy he says whilst holding two airdrop weapons XD
i jumped yesterday out of my car against a tree... it worked. i didnt get any dmg
"You young lads wouldn't expect someone like myself to play PUBG because I'm a 93 year old woman with 14 grandkids! However, I pwn n00bz each day of the week sonny so don't come around here with that weak shit ! merry Christmas sonny god bless"
Lol you put punch tires twice
1:26- Note that it is not optimal if the enemy is facing the nose of the car. (Bowling effect)
Even though it would be hard to make a 100 tip video you could have just gotten rid of all the repeats and just made it a 75 tip video
tips 1-10 you can shoot tires thanks

Can we punch out tires? Lol
"Don't keep the compensator. It's always best to keep your position quiet. Likely to draw more unwanted fire if you're shooting back with a compensator. 
Rule #101 3rd person is for bitches"
Suppressors should compensate. Due to the added weight and length of the suppressor it gives the bullet a longer travel range as well as a heavier front. This in turn reduces the bullet spread as well as recoil.
"great content, thanks!"
How do you deal with hackers? OC server is currently getting fucked by then hard every other game I die to them and every game the kill feed lights up with super suspect shit like 7 dead from head shots in 5 seconds by one player. It's a real shame.

"You can still jump out of moving vehicles if you hit the tree directly and not move, my mate did it just yesterday"
Videoen har hjulpet mig meget! Bliv ved mand! Elsker dine videoer! ❤️
"Why is view distance better with ""very low"" than ""ultra""?"
"Shadowplay, for me, is only good for recording, which it is amazing at.
For streaming, because I have a ryzen 1700 at 3.975ghz I won't use my gpu (NVENC) to stream, ONLY my cpu (x264 encoding) because it looks literally amazing in comparison to gpu streaming, and the gaming impact is only around 10% most of the time."

15:32 doesnt work anymore
Dude you got 200iq right
great video but you said that you can punch tires out twice
I was a bit suprised that I didn't see a tip about shooting or punching out windows to see better and prevent gun lowering when shooting.
I don't even play pubg. Lol
"the 0.5 seconds thing from using an item depends on your specific latency to the server too, it's not a blanket thing for everyone, I've tried it lots of times and it never works at 0.5 but does at 0.3 which is still worth knowing"
How do you loot faster while running through?  What are the keys on the keyboard for that?

"Great video man, most of the things I would point out already have I think. But thought I would just add my two cents. @ 19:30 you said the drop always lands in the blue, it might have been worth pointing out that 1st drop ALWAYS lands within the first white zone"

Instructions unclear: used bike and killed myself and lost the game :(
Hey didnt know if you knew but vaulting is coming out soon.
The best tip i got from watching your videos was to be aggressive. I have played so many games getting my loot and hiding until late game just to get popped in the head. I have so many chicken dinners now that I move around to see where the shot came from to shoot back. Thanks Fug
you forgot to mention that you can punch out tires with your hands
Tf is my audio delay
Great video!
"Thanks Mate, there were a few there that I didn't. Since you were mentioning Patch 1.0 a fair bit one change is that the buggy in patch 1.0 now needs boost to get to the top speed. I made a video about the vehicle changes and that was one of my findings."
what country are you from?
Your channel grows faster than my penis during intercourse

"You accidentally said Ctrl+T mutes game chat when it only mutes game chat

Congrats my bud. Told you 250K the end of the year and youll hit it buddy. Thank you very much for the How to record and edit video. Really means alot for the small guys. Great content buddy.

"You can also do Roofjumps on some little 2 stock buildings, with the attic. 
If there are boxes nearby, you can kinda crouch jump onto them and get on the roof, pretty neat spot for sniping."
Most important trick you missed is that you can Dab while dropping from the plane by pressing D .
Maybe another good tip would be that you can destroy doors and little huts (just like you did in the last clip)
When will patch 1.0 be live????

"7:42 Cars can spawn with brake lights on. This is useless. Just park near a spawn point and leave. 10:37 | 10:50 if you're going to demo in-game sounds, don't modify the levels. Your voice is WAY louder and you can't hear fuckall at that point."

"Thanks Fugglet, love your content man keep it up!"
downvote because of double tire fist punching tip... (not really)
"1. Congrats for the new rig, it took like 6 weeks to arrive, but definitely worth it.
2. Thanks for the video, gonna be honest, only thing I didn't know was the left alt key when firing a sniper.
3. I found a lot of weird/advantage spots, I guess I could make a video of it.
4. I learned that crates location would set next circle, they changed it, now it drops anywhere.

Hope one day we could play together! I am montogeek on Steam"

"hey, jeg ville bare spørge om du kunne lave en challenge hvor du skal dræbe alle du ser med en bil."

You can punch out tires with your fist

"Looking for help here guys, tried many other places it just didn’t work, my computer is pretty good, I average 120 FPS on some good settings (even tho I don’t need that much) but for some reason yesterday when I played whenever I opened some dead guy’s loot crate it dropped so much and I don’t know why. Like I could barely move it was so low, but the FPS bar still showed high 70... any suggestions?"

"Just a few things there Fuggman - you have 'punching out tires' on here twice, and the first instance of telling players about muting the game, you stated Ctrl+T (which just mutes voice chat - later on you mention this). Great stuff as always!!"
hey Fugglet where are you from
"That roof spot, I had to do that to get a crate that was on that roof!"
8:55 CTRL + M *
You mentioned punching out tires twice.
let's suppose you are writing a really important email to a colleague
"""All the loot on these tables disappears after you enter the plain."" NAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
LITERALLY EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 😂😂😂. First thing I saw as I opened up YouTube. Love you fugglet.
punch out tires was said twice
"This isn't tips and tricks, this is 100 facts, because knowing ""fastest falling distance"" isn't gonna help me to improve.."
U mentioned punching tiers twice
"fugglet join my squad we are looking for someone, we are all top 500 NA in FPP"
Clothes increase your carrying capacity c:
Tire punch twice. Tire punch twice.
I literally choked on number one. I swear I tested that out and it didn't fucking work for me. Thanks for the video Fugglet
I️ love it when he says “Potato”
Thanks for letting me know I can punch tires twice. Really got through

Does the airdrop always drop 2 crates?
"To mute the ingame volume, it is Ctrl-M not Ctrl-t. Ctrl-T mutes voice chat"
8:55 CTRL + M not CTRL + T
"8:33 You it is impossible to shoot through water in reall life, withe speed that the bullet travels and the density of the water when they both meet, the bullet is slowed to a complete stop in only a few inches of water. Search on here a video where the mythbusters shoot guns in water, youll see its physically impossible."
"8:55 its ctrl m by default, ctrl t mutes the game chat, and ctrl y to change the voice channels"
Holy so much Tips :D. Thanks for the tips!
8:55 He means Control+M
Nice video
"Possible others: the silencer also is a flashhider rendering the flashhider irrelevant if you have a silencer/snip. Both do improve deviation this was confirmed by devs but not compensation. It feels like it does, and people are used to it from other games like cod but it doesn’t. The airdrop nudge of death-Driving up to a drop on ground if someone is there hiding behind it before you just tap it with the car at a decent speed- it moves the drop just enough to kill them. We have all died to that. Kar98 bullet sleeve over cheek pad- the benefits of the sleeve vastly outweigh the cheekpad as a bolt action rifle. Also the compensator is almost practically useless on the Kar98, and other bolt actions. Other attachments have more benefits on these guns. Don’t ads shotguns, esp the sk12, which does make a nice secondary esp as it holds as you mentioned all the scopes and silencer so easy to scope swap on the fly. The Uaz is pronounced Lou-ahzz. Yeah with an L...crazy (Check out survival Russia YouTube channel he rebuilt one and all the Russians pronounce it that way on there.) You can zero tommy guns and other smgs to be more effective beyond the 50 it starts at. Don’t be a Fugglet- bind your first aid and boosts. ;) Good idea to carry 3-5 bandages if you are a noob and might get caught in blue as the deploy time might save your butt and buy you time to use first aid/ med kit. Jumping to reduce foot noise. If you are playing duos or squads everyone take off their shoes and you’ll be able to determine footsteps are your team easier over anyone lurking. Fugglet: Replace second tire punching tip with your jumping out of boat tips. Also you can mitigate fall damage from heights by using other things in the  environment easily- pubg parquor. You can put a car on a boat, as well as a motorcycle, if careful and take it across to island or mainland it’s a team effort but you can find videos of it. Motorcycle, Dacia, buggy, Uaz. As far as top speed. But each sucks or excels at something to make up for speed or lack of. If you can get two or more boats out on the water side by side in duos or squads it makes for a really fun sniper platform. The character movement(foot sway for example) you see your character do while prone or medding is client side only. No one else sees it.  Reloading, healing and boosts make a lot of noise - this doesn’t seem to be as well known as I catch people all the time that way. Molotov is highly underused; it’s great to block stairwells for reviving teammates or to trap a player. You used to be able to trap someone in a fap shake with a uaz or Dacia Parked in front of it backwards- haven’t done for awhile though. Super dick move. :)"
great video as always
confirmed Fugglet is a communist
Congrats on 150k bro I’ve been watching since u were at 20k and u have been growing an insane amount congrats and keep up the good work
"And videos like this are exactly the reason why every fucking idiot can get a win in this game....nothing skill anymore
Let the people fucking learn on there own...
Dont get me wrong i love your videos dude but just let them learn on there own"
What i often do at the hospital or school. Just every big bilding with roofs. If I manage to kill or escape the most players and only 1 or 2 are left. I grab a gun and chill o the roof trying to spot other Players looting. As soon as they show up I know exactly where there are and it's easy to kill them .
punch was mentionet twice
I love you for doing this free. Some people online were charging people for tips it's crazy!!!! You're a legend
It's funny coz I don't play pubg but I watched anyways
You can shoot through the small cracks in the destructible huts by the side of the roads.
Jumping on hills was nerfed in the TTS. That tip won't work in the 1.0 version of the game.
10:10 is incorrect. I did jump out of a moving vehicle at 80km/h. You just need to hit a wall before you hit the ground.
Control + M is for Muting the game! Great vid bud <3
You said that you could punch out tires twice in the video
15:07 your mic CUT off
13:28 holding the left key? does he mean left click? i didnt know this and will use it all the time now
"CTRL + M to mute master volume, and CTRL + T to mute voice chat"
Thank you
two videos in one day? Your the best Fugglet!
8:56 Did you mean CTRL+M?
"18:20 

In my experience, crossbow did not os level 3 helmet"
Potato
"Yo fugglet small error. To mute the plane it is ctrl+M, which is master volume. All ctrl+T does is mute the chat and people talking. Also, ctrl+Y changes your voice channel, from Team Only, None, and All. Love the channel keep up the great work my man."
punching out tires x2?
At 5:24 you can see there is no texture and its just the plain unreal engine map  lol
"i didn't understand ""small weapon top slot"" what does it change ?"
99 *
You da man
"Another tip

Don't trust your team mates"
8:56 Isn't Control + T for muting voice chat?
"Even if after hundred and hundred hours I know most of them, that must have taken long time to do this vid, very good job !"
9:00 CTRL+M*
"For me, ctrl+t is mute voice and ctrl+m for game volume"
Another Tip for vaulting. It is possible to reload by vaulting
"Naisu, it help me alotuuu"
"Do all these strats to ""make yourself less visible"" by changing backpack n shit and then you just play out in the open anyway"
"You said ctrl+T mutes the plane then later said ctrl+T mutes the mic chat, it's ctrl+M for master volume/plane for those wondering :) Good work fuggie <3"
Good video!
"You can crouch jump in 1.0 (at least you could on test-servers). You just need to do it earlier than now, or else it will ofc trigger the vault."
"U actually can pick up the airdrop which landed outside of the wall, just press tab at the space where it would be if it was inside the walls and u can see inside the container and still pick em up even tho they are far away from you."
"My default controls for muting master sound were Control + M, so yeh if ppl have my default controls that's the control."
8:20 it's tour d'apartments :D
9:00 ctrl m
"The tip at 9:00 isnt right thats how you mute people ingame which is just as useful really its ctrl+M to mute the game itself also ctrl+y changes who you can hear so everyone, no one or your team turns out you mention the ctrl+y thing later and that you mute people with ctrl+t"
Many of these tips will become irrelevant after vaulting update
Nice Fug. I'm to totally agree on the suppressor vs compensator. I always prefer compensator over the silencer.
awesomne...Thank you
Congrats on 150k subs.
one shot sniper! take ur time!
Muting the sound is CTRL + M and chat is CTRL + T
"i mean some of them are like
......"
"Helped alot , thanks man <3 ya"
"The M416 has great irons. A sight is not really needed for this gun, at least that's what I think.
And here's a fun fact that I came across on Youtube: IRL, suppressors increase damage because the added barrel length gives the gunpowder more time to burn, thereby increasing velocity and hence damage. Also, it reduces recoil to a certain extent. And it does something else that I don't remember. Here's a link to the vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWK2jHG5XfE"
in the time I watched this you gained 1k subs you at 151k now congratz you the best keep up the great work fucklet :D
"You forgot the most important tip of all. 

Don't be a potato."
"Det er dejligt endelig at se en Dansker der kan finde ud af noget ;D
Du er den bedste Fuggman!"
"Awesome, thanks for the effort"
"good job dude, nice compilation of tips."
"Guys it's Control M for muting the master volume, Control T just mutes voice chat."
Fugglet you're awesome and you deserve all your subs plus more! Keep up the good work man!
"8:56 CTRL + T mutes voice chat as default, CTRL + M mutes master volume"
You forgot to say that you can punch out tires!

"It’s not the only spot where you can get up on the bridge, you can do it most places"
"It's control M to master volume mute, and you can jump out of moving vehicles, you just aren't that great at doing so."
"Breaking tires with fist was twice, literally unwatchable"
8:55 ctrl+T ???
Suppressed s12k with 15 times is the most op gun
"Can i call you fuggy?





p l z"
"Reporting you fugglet, I caught some fan service at 5:45 that ain't good man. Showing it off like that I'm so disappointed in you"
For me Jumping out of vehicles still Works without Getting damaged :O

8:57 Control + M*
you can push beached boats back into the water with a buggy. saved me before when zone goes military and people beach them to hinder you.
"Best PUBG channel on youtube.. Gratz on 150K mate, well deserved"
10:04 da fuck
Well deserved 150k. And you deserve many more! 👍🏻
Fugglet is our god
Did Nvidia sponsor you?
Guys for game mute its ctrl + m not T
"Cheers bro, actually helped a lot"
Amazing babe
You have no recoil while prone
"btw fuplet, loot on the go only work if you're not lagging."
"9:57 ""here is the proof"" lmao the fuckin ingame stats have been unreliable since day 1.

10:09 ""and here is the proof"" you jumped out way too early. Still doable.

11:55 with a compensator it's managable by a decent player.

14:37 yes, you've mentioned that tip twice."
a fat video from fugglet is what you need everyday
"Also another tip, a ghuille suit hides your backpack!"

"BTW: Supressors DO somewhat compensate, they change the behaviour of the gun while hipfiring slightly, Playerunknown approved that. The stat that changes is called deviation and it is reduced by 5%."
I'm early today. Like if you are early too.

"Great content as always Fugglet :) I'd be interested in a late game guide. How to take the best decisions in the top 10, where to go, what stuff to drop what stuff to keep... Thanks :)"
You forgot to add that you can punch out tires with your fists!
"Heya fuggmaaaaann,
I just discovered a big when climbing up hill 
U can just „alt“ and watch behind you and then press spacebar if the Hill is steep enough and u are watching behind you u will just slide all the way up 
Pretty cool trick and if never saw anyone use it 

As soon u release „alt“ it will stop!

Ps pls rate this comment up so he will see it :) 


Have a nice day"

"17:44 | Locating shots - Move your alignment, to hear where the shots are coming from. Example in video.
17.54 | Swimming like a nut - Swimming backwards and holding your 'swim up' key while looking straight down, or forwards while looking straight up will make you jump out of the water somewhat uncontrollably. Not certain if this shows to other players (untested yet). (Sasha)
18:07 | Level 3 backpack skin - From airdrops has a different skin, a bit more camo. (CoffeeManXXL)
18:15 | Hide UI - Pressing CTRL + U will remove your entire HUD, in case a death icon or name is blocking your view.
18:21 | Crossbow 1 shot - 1 shots any type of helmet.
18:26 | Superman punch - Jumping while punching does a lot more damage.
18:40 | Focus the driver - In squads or duos, always focus the driver - if you get him/her knocked, the rest will have trouble taking over the vehicle / jumping out. (S P A C E.)
18:50 | Top of hills in fog - It’s a lot easier to see enemies on top of hills in the fog weather, stay clear of those.
19:02 | Don’t finish your knocks - If you engage a fight, knock one - look for the rest before you rush to finish the one knocked person.
19:20 | Airdrop Area - Always drops within the blue, if it starts flying before the next circle moves, it can land outside the white and out to the blue wall. Example in video.
19:38 | Nudge an airdrop - You can push airdrops with a grenade before they land, and hit them with your vehicle too. (tombull89)
19:43 | Loot an airdrop in boat - Be super close. (drewT)
19:47 | Use your gear - You don't bring gear home when you win, use it (awm, healing etc.)

This was supposed to be one of the punch out a tire that I accidently did twice:
Boost fuel usage - Boosting in vehicles consumes a lot more fuel, especially noticeable in the UAZ which has the smallest fuel capacity."
